### Goal of the project
*Is it clear to you from the proposal.md how the goal can be accomplished using Python and the specified packages?*

I think it is clear from the proposal.md file how the project will work, but I think there could be some elaboration on which specific packages will be used.

### The Data: 
*Is it clear to you from the proposal.md what the data for this project is, or will look like?*

It is clear from the proposal.md file that the data is .txt or .fasta sequences and labels in a FASTA format of primers and templates.

### The code:
*Does the current code include a proper skeleton (pseudocode) for starting this project?*

The current code has the files set up to start the project, but the code itself has not been entered yet.

*What can this code do so far?*

After our in class discussion, the first element of code will be read the file inputs, and the second element of code will clean it up so the program can use it.

*Given the project description, what are some individual functions that could be written to accomplish parts of this goal?*

Given the description, I think one additional function that could be written would be an visual example of what each section of code will do to complement the example of inputted code.

###Code contributions/ideas:

The discussed code contibution I will attempt is to create the main.py file for a command line interface with entry points so it can be called. I will also add a setup.py file with an entry point.
